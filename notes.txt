This is where I'm going to keep my notes for the talk until the talk is finished.

Current outline:

- Hello, I'm Zhian Kamvar and I work on Lesson Infrastructure at The Carpentries
- Purpose: I'm here to show you two things: how you can use our infrastructure
  to build accessible lessons with R and friends and how we used our core
  values to transform our lessons to a more modern and accessible format using
  R, but in order to do that, you need to know what The Carpentries is and
  before I start, I'm goint to tell you a little story about myself

- Hook:
  - Back in 2014, when I was a grad student, I taught my first workshop showing
    plant pathologists how to do population genetic analysis in R.
  - I knew a lot about popgen and plant pathology, but I knew next to nothing
    about inclusive teaching, live coding practices, or effective lesson
    development
  - Build website using RMarkdown, forced my collaborators to start using Git,
    fixed a lot of merge conflicts
  - Rebuilding the website was always a "close your eyes and hope it works"
    kinda process
  - We ran the workshop successfully at two conferences, but something was
    missing: we had no clue what our workshop participants actually learned from
    it.
  - Here's the thing, my advisor had not taught for several years befor this,
    If I had a way to get support I needed, such as a template for a lesson that
    would guide me in narrative elements and formative assessment, I could have
    succeeded in understanding what people learned from the workshop.
    I know now that the carpentries is a community that provides that support
    and gives people a safe space to grow and improve their teaching.

- The Carpentries
  - Mission (who else)
    - works to help institutions and individuals spread data science skills
      through building local and global communities of practice.
  - Identity (who)
    - community of volunteers trained in inclusive and effective teaching principles.
      Includes lesson maintainers, instructors, and instructor trainers.
  - Values (Why)
      We...

    Act Openly
    Empower One Another
    Value All Contributions

     We are...

    Always Learning
    Inclusive of All

     We champion...

    People First
    Access for All
    Community Collaboration
    Strength Through Diversity

  - Capabilities (how)
    - Over 3000 workshops to tens of thousands of learners across the globe with
      growing communities in Africa, The Middle East, Latin America, and East
      Asia as well.
    - Our instructors never teach alone: If you are starting out, you are always
      paired with an experienced instructor and any number of helpers.
    - You always have an opportunity to teach thanks to soon-to-be Dr. SherAaron
      Hurt, Director of Workshops.
    - Continued learning through open-source and open-licensed lesson materials
      freely available on GitHub

- Problem Statement
  - Lessons were built with Jekyll because it was what GitHub used, so there was
    no need for contributors to render the HTML manually
  - Have you ever worked with Jekyll?
  - Have you ever uttered a curse word while using Jekyll?
  - Have you ever had a fear of updating your blog because the template you
    used no longer works?
  - Over the course of two years, it became clear that the system was not easy
    to use... we needed to reevaluate.
  - Solution: Carpentries Workbench
    - Template + Three packages based on the framework of pkgdown
      - sandpaper: orchestration
      - pegboard: pre-flight validation
      - varnish: styling and CSS
      - available on the carpentries r-universe
  - Core-Values Driven Design
    - People first
    - Community Collaboration
    - Always Learning & Inclusive of All
    - Empower One Another

- We Champion People First

  - lesson wrapped around a blog: great for one or two lessons; a nightmare for
    > 100.
  - People First solution:
    - content for content; tools and styling separate
    - Use R
      - R's best asset is its community: https://twitter.com/yabellini/status/1523268802653212672
    - Careful testing on a big ship

- We Champion Community Collaboration

 - Instructor notes inline with the content allows a broader communication
   channel for instructors to communicate with one another and to provide
   feedback to maintainers
 - renv lockfiles and pull request previews allow for inspection of results and
   avoids "this works on my machine" arguments.


- Always Learning and Inclusive of All

  - people have better things to do than worry about errors
    - Reminders built in to The Workbench to include alt text and descriptive links
    - Multiple points of entry including RStudio cloud
    - not excluding anyone because they can not install Jekyll, Make, or Python
  - infrastructure: I'm always learning
    - Elephant in the room: we are not using quarto... yet
    - Modular design allows future integration of different tooling.

- We Empower One Another

 - Community lessons from The Carpentries Incubator
   - Path to peer review in the lab
   - collaborative lesson development
 - Model for Curriculum Maintenance
   - Curriculum Advisors <-> Maintainers <-> Instructors
   - Externalising styling simplifies the equation

- Testimonials
 - Saba
 - Toby
 - Athanasia
 - Sarah

- Get Involved!
  - Sure you can build a lesson with R, but think about the friends you'll make along the way!
  - Become an Instructor (https://carpentries.org/become-instructor/)

Talk name: Building Accessible Lessons with R and Friends


Notes from my own session
================================================================================

In order to understand my talk, you have to understand The Carpentries

We are a volunteer community that teach data and coding skills to researchers
worldwide.

We are community driven.

Building our lessons is very difficult.

Give vignette a day in the life of one of our maintainers

Mindset of carpentries maintainer

 - associate professor
    - two classes with tests graded
    - grants
    - grad students
    - tenure
    - children at home
 - Go to edit it and then something doesn't work and you don't know what broke
   when all you wanted to do was to fix a typo or add a plot.
 - Analogy: windows update

Connection: what we have done is that we've taking this workflow and externalised
it and rewritten it in R and separated the tools from the content so when you are
editing a markdown file you only have to worry about the content and not the tools

There are tools for accessibility and the defaults are accessible

Testimonials from people who have used the workbench and how it has improved their
workflow.

Why am I telling you about this? The Carpentries is a really welcoming community.
If you want to, you can be part of the community. If you want to develop a lesson,
we have The Carpentries Incubator where you can find collaborators and people who
want to teach the lesson.

You can get certified to teach carpentries lessons with evidence based teaching practises.

End of talk.


Queston: There are two sidebyside goals of the talk at the moment:

1. Join our community
2. Sharing the inforamtion about how you made the lessons more accessible

What's the priority between these two?

Join the carpentries is priority.

We can get both. There was a moment that we flashed by: what are our values?

We are an organisation that values people but we don't want the tools getting
the way for people to express who they are and what they want to contribute to
the Community.

You could take this inforamtion as an example of how you are living these values

The values are the parent and you will walk through how the workbench embodies
these values.

E.G. Inclusive of all: we don't exclude people just because they can't install Jekyll

Youll take the story you were going to share, but you are twisting it to highlight
those values. So what part of the story is best to demonstrate you put people first
and what part of that story highlights accessibility for all?

YOu can lead up to it and say "I want to tell you how we're living those values
in one very specific case which are these lessons" and you can then still set up
the problem with these lessons that everybody's encountered so that part of the
talk remains.

This way, the audience knows what the carpentries is all about so that when you get
to the end, you can say "join us" and it doesn't feel like, "oh! That's what you
wanted me to listen for?" We knew the whole time.


If the talk is mostly about joining the carpentries: what do people get out of
being in the carpentries?

Mildly familiar with The Carpentries and thinking from a personal standpoint,
I'd love to see this talk because it will give me the push to take the dive to
become an instructor. It would be super interesting to hear the fact that you
can get a certification that's recognised globally. It would be good to give
the benefits of it for people who don't know about the carpentries.

Hook: who we are, why we exist, you can be part of a good community
We are a great community because we have these values and we live by them.

This is one of the _many_ ways we live by our values.

You can then come home by giving testimonials of why people join our community

Hooks:

 - why fight with Jekyll?
 - utility of the carpentries as a whole: data science was not a thing and
   there is no certification.

maybe start in the world of community and start with how young this field is.
