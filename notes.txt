This is where I'm going to keep my notes for the talk until the talk is finished.

Current outline:
Talk outline: Building Accessible Lessons with R and Friends

Notes from my own session
-------------------------

In order to understand my talk, you have to understand The Carpentries

We are a volunteer community that teach data and coding skills to researchers
worldwide.

We are community driven.

Building our lessons is very difficult.

Give vignette a day in the life of one of our maintainers

Mindset of carpentries maintainer

 - associate professor
    - two classes with tests graded
    - grants
    - grad students
    - tenure
    - children at home
 - Go to edit it and then something doesn't work and you don't know what broke
   when all you wanted to do was to fix a typo or add a plot. 
 - Analogy: windows update

Connection: what we have done is that we've taking this workflow and externalised
it and rewritten it in R and separated the tools from the content so when you are 
editing a markdown file you only have to worry about the content and not the tools

There are tools for accessibility and the defaults are accessible

Testimonials from people who have used the workbench and how it has improved their
workflow.

Why am I telling you about this? The Carpentries is a really welcoming community.
If you want to, you can be part of the community. If you want to develop a lesson, 
we have The Carpentries Incubator where you can find collaborators and people who
want to teach the lesson. 

You can get certified to teach carpentries lessons with evidence based teaching practises.

End of talk.


Queston: There are two sidebyside goals of the talk at the moment:

1. Join our community
2. Sharing the inforamtion about how you made the lessons more accessible

What's the priority between these two? 

Join the carpentries is priority.

We can get both. There was a moment that we flashed by: what are our values?

We are an organisation that values people but we don't want the tools getting
the way for people to express who they are and what they want to contribute to
the Community.

You could take this inforamtion as an example of how you are living these values

The values are the parent and you will walk through how the workbench embodies
these values. 

E.G. Inclusive of all: we don't exclude people just because they can't install Jekyll


Youll take the story you were going to share, but you are twisting it to highlight
those values. So what part of the story is best to demonstrate you put people first
and what part of that story highlights accessibility for all?

YOu can lead up to it and say "I want to tell you how we're living those values 
in one very specific case which are these lessons" and you can then still set up
the problem with these lessons that everybody's encountered so that part of the
talk remains. 

This way, the audience knows what the carpentries is all about so that when you get
to the end, you can say "join us" and it doesn't feel like, "oh! That's what you 
wanted me to listen for?" We knew the whole time. 


If the talk is mostly about joining the carpentries: what do people get out of
being in the carpentries?

Mildly familiar with The Carpentries and thinking from a personal standpoint,
I'd love to see this talk because it will give me the push to take the dive to
become an instructor. It would be super interesting to hear the fact that you
can get a certification that's recognised globally. It would be good to give
the benefits of it for people who don't know about the carpentries. 

Hook: who we are, why we exist, you can be part of a good community
We are a great community because we have these values and we live by them.

This is one of the _many_ ways we live by our values.

You can then come home by giving testimonials of why people join our community

Hooks: 

 - why fight with Jekyll?
 - utility of the carpentries as a whole: data science was not a thing and
   there is no certification. 

maybe start in the world of community and start with how young this field is.

Introduction
-------------

Mission: The Carpentries builds global capacity in essential data and
computational skills for conducting efficient, open, and reproducible research.
We train and foster an active, inclusive, diverse community of learners and
instructors that promotes and models the importance of software and data in
research. We collaboratively develop openly-available lessons and deliver these
lessons using evidence-based teaching practices. We focus on people conducting
and supporting research.

Our Values
-----------
  We...

Act Openly
Empower One Another
Value All Contributions

 We are...

People First
Access for All
Community Collaboration

Core Value Driven Design

We Champion People First

> We believe that the individuals who make up our community are the most
> important part of our organisation and our strongest resource. **We strive to
> make decisions that lower barriers for individual participation.**

---List tasks of an academic's workday---

using jekyll:

jekyll serve

"command Jekyll not found"

bundle exec jekyll serve
bundler: command not found: jekyll
Install missing gem executables with `bundle install`

Audience Survey about who has used Jekyll and who has uttered a curse word when using Jekyll

Creating lessons is focussed on content, not tooling
Workbench built using R
> R's best asset is its community: https://twitter.com/yabellini/status/1523268802653212672
No new syntax to learn

We Champion Community Collaboration

 - Carpentries Incubator
 - Instructor notes inline with the content allows a broader communication
   channel for instructors to communicate with one another and to provide
   feedback to maintainers
 - renv lockfiles and pull request previews allow for inspection of results and
   avoids "this works on my machine" arguments.

We are Always Learning and Inclusive of All

 - We add sensible checks to make sure lessons are accessible
    - check for link text
    - check for alt text
 - Workbench can be run from any R instance, including RStudio Cloud
 
We Empower One Another

> We help people build knowledge by creating a conducive environment for the
> exchange of skills, perspectives and experiences that empower people and
> enable them to reach their potential.
