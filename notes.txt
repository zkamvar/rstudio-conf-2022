This is where I'm going to keep my notes for the talk until the talk is finished.

Current outline:

- Purpose: I'm here to show you two things: how we transformed our lessons to a more modern and accessible format using R and how you can use The Carpentries Workbench to build accessible lessons with R and friends, but in order to do that, you need to know what The Carpentries is and before I start, I'm goint to tell you a little story about myself 
- Hook:
  - I taught my first workshop in R ten years ago
  - I knew nothing about inclusive teaching, live coding practices, or effective lesson development
  - Build website using RMarkdown, forced my collaborators to start using Git, fixed a lot of merge conflicts
  - We ran the workshop successfully at two conferences, but something was missing: we had no clue whether or not our workshop participants actually learned anything.
  - Rebuilding the website was always a "close your eyes and hope it works" kinda process
  - If I had known how to join The Carpentries back then, the lesson would have looked much different and we would make sure our attendees got something out of the workshop.
- The Carpentries
  - Trains people in SW dev and data science skills for effective work and carreer dev
  - Builds community and local capacity for teaching and learning these skills and perspectives.
  - Community is important: our trained instructors are volunteers.
  - Our lessons and everything we do is open and free to access and remix online
  - The community has delivered more than 3500 workshops to tens of thousands of learners across the globe, with growing communities in Africa, The Middle East, Latin America, and East Asia as well.- This is not an accident! In 2019, Kari L. Jordan, Amy Hodge, Tracy Teal, and Sarah Rono synthesized from our community a set of core values that we hold and that drive our work.
- In 2018 we did a survey of maintainers who responded that overall, the process of building lessons was broken. Responding to this survey, we rebuilt our lessons infrastructure from the ground up sing our core-value driven design

- We Champion People First

  - lesson wrapped around a blog
  - Imagine that you are an associate professor: classes, papers, grants, grad students, talks, etc.
      - part of your service is maintaining a lesson for the carpentries
      - jekyll serve becomes bundle install; bundle exec jekyll serve
  - Who has used Jekyll?
  - Who has uttered a curse word because of Jekyll?
  - People First solution: 
    - content for content; tools separate
    - Use R
      - R's best asset is its community: https://twitter.com/yabellini/status/1523268802653212672


- We Champion Community Collaboration

 - Carpentries Incubator
 - Instructor notes inline with the content allows a broader communication
   channel for instructors to communicate with one another and to provide
   feedback to maintainers
 - renv lockfiles and pull request previews allow for inspection of results and
   avoids "this works on my machine" arguments.

- Always Learning and Inclusive of All

  - Reminders built in to The Workbench to include alt text and descriptive links.
  - Multiple points of entry including RStudio cloud

- We Empower One Another

 - Community lessons from The Carpentries Incubator
   - Path to peer review in the lab
   - collaborative lesson development
 - Model for Curriculum Maintenance
   - Curriculum Advisors <-> Maintainers <-> Instructors
   - Externalising styling simplifies the equation

- Testimonials
 - Saba
 - Toby
 - Athanasia
 - Sarah

- Get Involved!
  - Become an Instructor
  - Become a Maintainer
  - Host a Workshop!
  - Teach, create, contribute to, or review a lesson!


Talk name: Building Accessible Lessons with R and Friends


Notes from my own session
================================================================================

In order to understand my talk, you have to understand The Carpentries

We are a volunteer community that teach data and coding skills to researchers
worldwide.

We are community driven.

Building our lessons is very difficult.

Give vignette a day in the life of one of our maintainers

Mindset of carpentries maintainer

 - associate professor
    - two classes with tests graded
    - grants
    - grad students
    - tenure
    - children at home
 - Go to edit it and then something doesn't work and you don't know what broke
   when all you wanted to do was to fix a typo or add a plot. 
 - Analogy: windows update

Connection: what we have done is that we've taking this workflow and externalised
it and rewritten it in R and separated the tools from the content so when you are 
editing a markdown file you only have to worry about the content and not the tools

There are tools for accessibility and the defaults are accessible

Testimonials from people who have used the workbench and how it has improved their
workflow.

Why am I telling you about this? The Carpentries is a really welcoming community.
If you want to, you can be part of the community. If you want to develop a lesson, 
we have The Carpentries Incubator where you can find collaborators and people who
want to teach the lesson. 

You can get certified to teach carpentries lessons with evidence based teaching practises.

End of talk.


Queston: There are two sidebyside goals of the talk at the moment:

1. Join our community
2. Sharing the inforamtion about how you made the lessons more accessible

What's the priority between these two? 

Join the carpentries is priority.

We can get both. There was a moment that we flashed by: what are our values?

We are an organisation that values people but we don't want the tools getting
the way for people to express who they are and what they want to contribute to
the Community.

You could take this inforamtion as an example of how you are living these values

The values are the parent and you will walk through how the workbench embodies
these values. 

E.G. Inclusive of all: we don't exclude people just because they can't install Jekyll

Youll take the story you were going to share, but you are twisting it to highlight
those values. So what part of the story is best to demonstrate you put people first
and what part of that story highlights accessibility for all?

YOu can lead up to it and say "I want to tell you how we're living those values 
in one very specific case which are these lessons" and you can then still set up
the problem with these lessons that everybody's encountered so that part of the
talk remains. 

This way, the audience knows what the carpentries is all about so that when you get
to the end, you can say "join us" and it doesn't feel like, "oh! That's what you 
wanted me to listen for?" We knew the whole time. 


If the talk is mostly about joining the carpentries: what do people get out of
being in the carpentries?

Mildly familiar with The Carpentries and thinking from a personal standpoint,
I'd love to see this talk because it will give me the push to take the dive to
become an instructor. It would be super interesting to hear the fact that you
can get a certification that's recognised globally. It would be good to give
the benefits of it for people who don't know about the carpentries. 

Hook: who we are, why we exist, you can be part of a good community
We are a great community because we have these values and we live by them.

This is one of the _many_ ways we live by our values.

You can then come home by giving testimonials of why people join our community

Hooks: 

 - why fight with Jekyll?
 - utility of the carpentries as a whole: data science was not a thing and
   there is no certification. 

maybe start in the world of community and start with how young this field is.
