Introduction

Mission: The Carpentries builds global capacity in essential data and
computational skills for conducting efficient, open, and reproducible research.
We train and foster an active, inclusive, diverse community of learners and
instructors that promotes and models the importance of software and data in
research. We collaboratively develop openly-available lessons and deliver these
lessons using evidence-based teaching practices. We focus on people conducting
and supporting research.

Creating lessons is focussed on content, not tooling
Workbench built using R

No new syntax to learn

We Champion Community Collaboration

 - Carpentries Incubator
 - Instructor notes inline with the content allows a broader communication
   channel for instructors to communicate with one another and to provide
   feedback to maintainers
 - renv lockfiles and pull request previews allow for inspection of results and
   avoids "this works on my machine" arguments.

We are Always Learning and Inclusive of All

 - We add sensible checks to make sure lessons are accessible
    - check for link text
    - check for alt text
 - Workbench can be run from any R instance, including RStudio Cloud
 
We Empower One Another

> We help people build knowledge by creating a conducive environment for the
> exchange of skills, perspectives and experiences that empower people and
> enable them to reach their potential.
