Hello, I'm Zhian Kamvar and I work on Lesson Infrastructure at The Carpentries.
I'm going to tell you two things: how you can use The Carpentries
Workbench to build accessible lessons, and how we used R to build the Workbench,
which allowed us to transform our lessons from looking like this

There are a lot of people and funding institutions that I need to thank
for supporting this work, and that can be a talk in and of itself. 

And in order for me to give this talk, you need to know who The Carpentries are
and before I get to that, I'm going to tell you a little story about myself.

Back in 2014, when I was a grad student, I wrote and ran my first workshop
teaching plant pathologists how to do population genetics in R (if you are
unfamiliar with population genetics in plant pathology, thing 23 and me, 
but for mold).

I knew a lot about population genetics and plant pathology, but I knew next to nothing about evidence-based teaching practices, live coding, or formative assessment. 
For this workshop, I wrote everything in R markdown, forced my collaborators to use Git, and fixed a lot of merge conflicts.
We ran the workshop successfully for a couple of conferences and lots of 
people liked it, but there were two things that were bothering me:
1. The build process was a kind of "close your eyes and hope it works" kind of
   procedure.
2. I had no clue what our audience actually learned from the workshop

Here's the thing, my advisor was a government scientist and had not taught for
several years before this, If I had a way to get support I needed, such as a
template for a lesson that would guide me in narrative elements and formative
assessment, I could have succeeded in understanding what people learned from the
workshop. I know now that the carpentries is a community that provides that
support and gives people a safe space to grow and improve their teaching.

The Carpentries is a global organization whose mission is to spread data science
skills to researchers around the globe, thus democratizing access to data.

We do this by building and fostering communities of practice

The Carpentries community is made up of volunteers who are trained in and
dedicated to evidence-based teaching practices. This includes not only
instructors, but instructor trainers, and lesson maintainers as well. We may all
come from different backgrounds, but we come together through our core values

And for the last decade, we have shown that by acting on these values, we can
achieve so much.

???

Since 2012 and as of the end of 2021, we have run 3,000 workshops in 64 countries and trained 3,419 volunteer instructors to deliver our 45 collaboratively developed, open lessons to 74,000 novice learners at our 92 member sites.

This is all achieved because, when we teach workshops, we never teach alone.

When you teach a workshop for the first time, there is always at least one other
instructor who has taught this workshop before who can give you support. And
there are ALWAYS workshops that you can teach thanks to the efforts of the (soon
to be) Dr. SherAaron Hurt, our Director of Workshops. 

And all of these workshops are possible thanks to our open-source and open-licened
lessons that we host on GitHub

This where instructors can give lesson maintainers feedback that improves our
curriculum. And it is these lessons that I want to focus the rest of my talk
because, over the years, we have noticed that our core values have not been
well-reflected in our lesson infrastructure.

Back when I was a grad student, The lessons of Software Carpentry and Data
Carpentry were built similar to how I built my own workshop lesson: rendering
the HTML from markdown manually on personal computers and then pushing to
GitHub. To overcome this barrier, we moved the infrastructure to use Jekyll, the
static site generator.

This gave us the advantage of being able to have people write markdown without
having to worry about rendering HTML. And I want to pause here and do a bit of
audience participation. I'm going to ask you some questions, and if the answer
is "yes", clap twice. Okay? Ready?

Over the last few years, we began to notice that our infrastructure was still
serving as a barrier. People were intimidated by the folder structure and the
toolchain used to build the lessons. In short, it was not easy to use.

In 2020, I was hired to re-imagine the lesson infrastructure from the ground up and created The Carpentries Workbench

Based on the design of the {pkgdown} package, it consists of three R packages
that provide control, validation, and styling for lessons based on carpentries
principles.

Sandpaper is the package that you work with directly to build your lesson website
from markdown or RMarkdown.

Pegboard is running in the backend and provides pre-flight validation for your
lesson to ensure all of the markdown components make sense.

.bottom.credit[**hex design: Omar Khan**]

Varnish comes in at the end and provides HTML, CSS, and JavaScript styling for
the website, and if you don't like it, you can create your own package. 

In our re-imaginging of the infrastructure, we utilized what I like to call
core-values driven design

# Core Values Driven Design

We used our core values to inform how we would redesign the infrastructure so
that it best served our community, and I'm going to highlight a few here.

Starting with our goal to Champion People First

We believe that the individuals who make up our community are the most important part of our organisation and our strongest resource.

When I was searching for a generator for our lessons, I looked for candidates
that would have plenty of onramps for beginners and ended up with R because of
its community, which is highlighted in this tweet from Yanina Bellini last May:

# Champion People First

[![
Tweet from @yabellini with 97 likes on May 8, 2022 that reads, "Some people laugh when I
Tell them that R's best feature as language is its community.
But I'm very serious. Especially @RLadiesGlobal has been such a positive
agent of change for so many people."
This tweet quotes a tweet from @gvwilson that links to his post about
positive and negative openness: https://third-bit.com/2019/05/11/positive-and-negative-openness/
](img/r-community-tweet.png)](https://twitter.com/yabellini/status/1523268802653212672)

???

R is just chock-full of welcoming communities, which you all probably have felt
at this very conference and it only makes sense that we would want to support a
language that has a supportive community.

# Champion People First

![screen shot of lesson web page that contains an in-line instructor note that is grey with a magenta square with a pencil icon to the left of the heading. The note reads "While working with the example for mutate(), it is difficult to see the "weight" columns on a zoomed in RStudio screen. (in bold) Including a select() command to select the columns "weight_kg" and "weight_lb" makes it easier to view how the "weight" columns are changed.](img/instructor-note.png)

???

Thinking about the lesson contents themselves, another way we have championed
people first is to virtually increase the number of instructors you teach with
by incorporating in-line instructor notes into the lessons. This way, the impact
of an experienced instructors teaching can have a clear throughline to those
teaching the lesson for the first time. 

And this also highlights ways that we are always learning and champion access
for all.

???

When folks are working on lessons, they are volunteering their time and may not
always remember to include alternative text for images or provide descriptive
links. The validation by {pegboard} provides helpful reminders in the console
and on GitHub of places where these elements can be improved. 

Moreover, we have build the workbench to be agnostic to where you work, so you
can build it anywhere you can run R, which means that you can use RStudio, VSCode,
Vim, or even RStudio cloud if you don't have your own computer
