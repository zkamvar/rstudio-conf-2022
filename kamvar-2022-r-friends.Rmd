Hello, I'm Zhian Kamvar and I work on Lesson Infrastructure at The Carpentries.
I'm going to tell you two things: how you can use The Carpentries
Workbench to build accessible lessons, and how we used R to build the Workbench,
which allowed us to transform our lessons from looking like this

There are a lot of people and funding institutions that I need to thank
for supporting this work, and that can be a talk in and of itself. 

And in order for me to give this talk, you need to know who The Carpentries are
and before I get to that, I'm going to tell you a little story about myself.

Back in 2014, when I was a grad student, I wrote and ran my first workshop
teaching plant pathologists how to do population genetics in R (if you are
unfamiliar with population genetics in plant pathology, think 23 and me, 
but for mold).

  - I knew a lot about popgen and plant pathology, but I knew next to nothing
    about inclusive teaching, live coding practices, or effective lesson
    development
  - Build website using RMarkdown, forced my collaborators to start using Git,
    fixed a lot of merge conflicts
  - Rebuilding the website was always a "close your eyes and hope it works"
    kinda process
  - We ran the workshop successfully at two conferences, but something was
    missing: we had no clue _what_ our workshop participants actually learned
    from it.
  - Here's the thing, my advisor had not taught for several years befor this,
    If I had a way to get support I needed, such as a template for a lesson that
    would guide me in narrative elements and formative assessment, I could have
    succeeded in understanding what people learned from the workshop.
    I know now that the carpentries is a community that provides that support
    and gives people a safe space to grow and improve their teaching.

The Carpentries is a global organization whose mission is to spread data science
skills to researchers around the globe, thus democratizing access to data.

We do this by building and fostering communities of practice

The Carpentries community is made up of volunteers who are trained in and
dedicated to evidence-based teaching practices. This includes not only
instructors, but instructor trainers, and lesson maintainers as well. We may all
come from different backgrounds, but we come together through our core values

Since 2012 and as of the end of 2021, we have run 
 - 3,000 workshops in 
 - 64 countries and trained 
 - 3,419 volunteer instructors to deliver our 
 - 45 collaboratively developed, open lessons to 
 - 74,000 novice learners at our 
 - 92 member sites.

This is all achieved because, when we teach workshops, we never teach alone.

When you teach a workshop for the first time, there is always at least one other
instructor who has taught this workshop before who can give you support. And
there are ALWAYS workshops that you can teach thanks to the efforts of the (soon
to be) Dr. SherAaron Hurt, our Director of Workshops. 


Workshops and continued learning only possible through open-source and

And it is these lesson materials that I want to focus the rest of my talk
because, over the years, we have noticed that our core values have not been
well-reflected in our lesson infrastructure.

These lessons have a long history in how they were built, originally being
written in pure HTML, but as it stands now, they are built using Jekyll.

Over the last few years, we began to notice that our infrastructure was still
serving as a barrier. People were intimidated by the folder structure and the
toolchain used to build the lessons. In short, it was not easy to use.

In 2020, I was hired to re-imagine the lesson infrastructure from the ground up 


---
background-color: var(--cp-mist)
class: middle, center

![](img/flow.svg)
???

We knew that we wanted a system to avoid having a lesson wrapped around a blog where the tools, the inputs and the outputs were kept separate.  
This lead to the creation of The Carpentries Workbench

It operates on a modular workflow that clearly separates source files from
derivatives and the tools needed to build them. 
Based on the design of the {pkgdown} package, it consists of three R packages
that provide control, validation, and styling for lessons based on carpentries
principles.

Sandpaper is the package that you work with directly to build your lesson website
from markdown or RMarkdown.

Pegboard is running in the backend and provides pre-flight validation for your
lesson to ensure all of the markdown components make sense.

Varnish comes in at the end and provides HTML, CSS, and JavaScript styling for
the website, and if you don't like it, you can create your own package. 

In our re-imaginging of the infrastructure, we utilized what I like to call
core-values driven design

that would have plenty of onramps for beginners and ended up with R

R is just chock-full of welcoming communities, which you all probably have felt
at this very conference and it only makes sense that we would want to support a
language that has a supportive community.

Of course, the workbench stands out in another way.

![screen shot of lesson web page that contains a section of a lesson called "Mutate" which instructs learners how to use the `mutate()` function to create a new variable for weight in kilograms.](img/no-instructor-note.png)


???

Thinking about the lesson contents themselves, another way we have championed
people first is to virtually increase the number of instructors you teach with. Sometimes, you need extra tips for working with the lessons in the context of teaching a lesson, such as this situation here. 


---
background-color: var(--cp-buttercup)
class: middle

```r

  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000)
```
.center[![](img/example-mutate.png)]

???

When you display a wide tibble on a zoomed-in RStudio screen, it's difficult to
discern where the "weight" columns are and throws a bit of chaos into the
teaching.

But, by incorporating in-line instructor notes into the lessons, experienced
instructors can communicate with other instructors through time.

(in bold) Including a select() command to select the columns "weight_kg" and "weight_lb" makes it easier to view how the "weight" columns are changed.](img/instructor-note.png)

The workbench uses {renv} in the background for R lessons so that they come with
batteries included. Importantly, when developing a lesson, you do not need to
know how to use {renv} to work with the lesson.

And this really ties in with the next set of core values.

Access for all means that you are not limited by what you can install in order
to work with and evaluate contributions to your lesson. 

Pull requests are great for showing you what's changed in your lesson,
but when you are working with R Markdown you want to be able to see the results
and you want to make sure there are no unexpected side-effects.

pull request rendering of markdown intermediate outputs allows contributors to
