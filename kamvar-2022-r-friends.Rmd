![A selfie in a conference center hallway from the chest up of Zhian Kamvar with shaggy dark brown hair, thick black-rimmed oval glasses, a blue button down shirt, and a black bow tie with random white lines traversing it. He is wearing a green conference lanyard and a strap of a soulder bag with a button on it is also visible. His face shows youthful exhuberance as he smiles into the camera and holds up one hand much like agent Dale Cooper would do on the TV series 'Twin Peaks'](img/bb-zhi.jpg)

There are coffee cups on the tables. In the background, Zhian Kamvar is wearing a bright blue polo shirt and checkered shorts as he reaches up and points to a twiggy-looking diagram (minimum spanning tree) displayed on the projector screen.](img/popgen.jpeg)

What makes us stand out is not the fact that we use evidence-based practices in
teaching, it's that we align all of our decisions with our core values: we put
people first and we value all contributions.

Tell them that R's best feature as language is its community.
But I'm very serious. Especially @RLadiesGlobal has been such a positive
agent of change for so many people."
